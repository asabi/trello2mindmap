# A script to convert a specific trello board, or all trello boards in an account to a mindmap

A simple PHP script that uses the Trello api to generate a free mind file. Can also be opened on iThoughts.

Assigned members and labels become sub nodes.

Each node is a link to the trello item.

If using parent/child management for Trello, this script will show the relationship on the mindmap.

You can specify lists that are considered "done", and the script will show them as completed tasks, otherwise the script uses the check lists to figure out if an item is compelted.
