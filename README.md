# A script to convert a specific trello board, or all trello boards in an account to a mindmap

A simple PHP script that uses the Trello api to generate a free mind file. Can also be opened on iThoughts.

Assigned members and labels become sub nodes.
 
Each node is a link to the trello item.

If using parent/child management for Trello, this script will show the relationship on the mindmap.
